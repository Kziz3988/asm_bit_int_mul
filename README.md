# About the Project

It supports multiplying two 80-million-digit unsigned integers, or a one-digit integer with a 500-million-digit integer theoretically.

However, due to lack of optimization, multiplying extremely large nubers will be very slow.

# How to Use

Codes are in 'main.asm'. You can compile it with masm, or open the whole project with Visual Studio 2017.

The compiled executable file is 'bit_int_mul.exe'. You can run it directly.
